Javascript to create play / pause buttons for multiple video objects

**The javascript creates three sets of play / pause buttons
for three different video objects.**

This could easily be turned into an array driven mechanism for any number of html video objects with corresponding play / pause buttons

Accessible to a degree.

*Cheers!*
